Users view websites on mobile phones, tables, desktop monitors, large screens, and it is important to give the best user experience no matter what on what screen size a website is open.         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;li  class=\"question\"&gt;What mobile first design is, and why it's important.&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;p class=\"answer\"&gt;Mobile first design is an approach when a website layout is created for small screens first, and then scaled up for larger screens. As in most cases mobile devices are tend to be less powerful than devices with big screens, a website will be loading faster as it won't load extra code (@media queries); so @media queries will be loaded only for bigger screens, meaning there will be less unuseful code for mobile devices.         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;li  class=\"question\"&gt;What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;p class=\"answer\"&gt;A framework is a set of rules and concepts that helps to build a website faster as it solves common type of difficulties. A framework provides a common structure that can be reused and amended. However, there are a few disadvantages of using a framework: unused code in your project, time consuming to learn rules of a particular framework.         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;li class=\"question\"&gt;What a wireframe is and why we use it.&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;p class=\"answer\"&gt;Wireframe is a basic visual representation of elements on a website, and it helps to structure and create an information hierarchy.

While HTML is a structure, CSS is a style, Javascript adds interactive elements to a webpage, and also makes a webpage to react on user's actions. So basically JS is able to change web page content or style in response to events coming from user's side.         &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;li  class=\"question\"&gt;Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;p class=\"answer\"&gt;           Javascript supports control flow statements, e.g. if, for, while. Example from real life: &lt;u&gt;IF today is Saturday&lt;/u&gt;, THEN get up at 9am, otherwise get up at 7am. In this example &lt;u&gt;\"if today is Saturday\"&lt;/u&gt; is a control flow statement.&lt;br&gt;           Loops allows you to execute the same blosk of code a number of times. Example from real life: &lt;u&gt;WHILE baking bread&lt;/u&gt;, set the temperature at 200 °C.

The task was to create a string that represents an 8×8 grid of symbols (\"#\"). I couldn't figured out how to apply loops and to link if/else statement to decide to put a space of a hash sign. I wrote preudocode, but it didn't help me. After trying different approaches, I googled and found out about String.repeat() function that I easily applied and the problem was solved.&lt;br&gt;           What I learned from this case is there are multiple ways to solve a problem, and if you are blocked with one method, you need to think out of the box, and try different approaches, the ones you probably even haven't considered before.         &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;li  class=\"question\"&gt;How confident do you feel using the problem solving techniques and process?&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;p class=\"answer\"&gt;           &lt;ul class=\"post-10\"&gt;         &lt;li&gt;  Pseudocode really works for me, as in fact it is a plan of actions, and gives the structure to the future program.&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;  Reading error message sometimes is helpful too, even though I tend to ignore them..&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;  Console.logging and Googling are probably my helpers # 1 at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;  I haven't tried rubber ducky method, but I think I will one day.&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;/ul&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;li  class=\"question\"&gt;Explain .map(), .filter() and .reduce() functions. &lt;/li&gt;         &lt;p class=\"answer\"&gt;         &lt;ul class=\"post-10\"&gt;          &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;.map()&lt;/b&gt; function helps you to create a new array, and new elements in this array will be a result of a function you applied. Let's imagine you had a bowl of apples (this is an array), and you baked them (i.e. applied a function), once you took your baked apples from the oven and put them into a bowl you got a new array.&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;with &lt;b&gt;.filter()&lt;/b&gt; method you can create a new array, which will contain only the elements that passed certain requirements determined by a function. So.. coming back to our apples. This time you have a bowl with green and red apples (meaning your initial array). Now you want to &lt;em&gt;filter()&lt;/em&gt; them, and you take out all green apples, leaving only red ones in your bowl. You just got your new array!&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;.reduce()&lt;/b&gt; method converts your array of many elements into a single value by applying a function to each element. This time you have a bowl with apples, sugar, flour, butter and cinnamon. You apply a &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; function, which mixes (sums up) all your ingredients (elements), bakes them, and as a result you get apple crumble (just one single element).&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=\"apple\"&gt; &lt;p id=\"clickhere\"&gt;CLICK HERE&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;"}),

            content: "&lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li class=\"question\"&gt;What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;p class=\"answer\"&gt;   When you deep self-awareness, you develop clarity within yourself. With self-awareness you are able to access your own inner wisdom. And self-awareness is the importand part of emotional intelligence, which in its turn is a singnificant part of mindfulness. Emotional awareness operates at the level of physiology and self-assessment is at the level of meaning. Once you assess yourself accurately, you are able to see your strengths and weaknesses, that you can analyse. Self-assessment comes from  emotional awareness. The concept is in linear relationship \"between the three emotional competencies of self-awareness—that strong emotional awareness leads to more accurate self-assessment, which in turn leads to higher self-confidence\".         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;li  class=\"question\"&gt;What was your experience of the self awareness practices?&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;p class=\"answer\"&gt;         I liked the idea of journaling, found it's a good practice of self-discovery by writing. And I found it's interesting how the author compared journaling \"as mindfulness of thoughts and emotions\".         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;li  class=\"question\"&gt;What did you take away from the \"My Emotions are Not Me\" section?&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;p class=\"answer\"&gt;           While we tend to think that our emotions are a part of us, as we deepen our self-awareness, we begin to realise that we are not our emotions. Emotions are only what we feel, but not who we are. It's like clouds - they are not the sky, they are just in the sky, coming and going away...         &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;"}),

I sent an enquiry to resource manager, and my request was declined with the comment that we didn't have enough engineers. I think that every project is important for the company and customer service should be at its highest level even for small customers.             &lt;/p&gt;             &lt;p class=\"answer\"&gt;               View #2.&lt;br&gt;               We received an enquiry to assign an engineer for a customer we don't have a contract with. We only have one available engineer at the moment, and if he is assigned to this small task, in case we get a call from one of our main customers (the ones that are on contract with us), we won't be able to cover their call. It is better to delay an unimportant call that brings ~$100 profit to the company, and wait for more resources available, rather than to risk our relationship with big customers.             &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt;"}),
